stack.

![](\ref openpowerlink_architecture.png)

The openPOWERLINK stack is separated into a user layer and a kernel layer. The user
layer contains the higher level parts whereas the kernel layer contains the lower
level and time critical parts. The communication between user and kernel layer
is performed by a communication abstraction layer (CAL).
